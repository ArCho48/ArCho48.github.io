## Domain-inspired learning on graphs <!--(/projects//powAlloc.md)-->
Developed a hybrid framework to augment an iterative power allocation algorithm (WMMSE) with graph neural network (GNN) based learning modules for fast and efficient power allocation in SISO ([`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10812),[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02250)) and MIMO ([`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06992),[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06992)) wireless networks. Theorized and empirically validated stability bounds on the hybrid algorithm with respect to input perturbations ([`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07471)).
