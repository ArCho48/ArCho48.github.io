## Application of Neural Tangent Kernels on graphs
Developed an efficient framework to extend Graph-NTK for inductive node-level downstream tasks with skip connections on large graphs ([`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03763)).
To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:
