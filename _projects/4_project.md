## Anomaly detection on large-scale temporal graphs
Developed a _heterogeneous temporal graph model_ for anomaly detection on large-scale time-varying user-attribute graphs with significant class imbalance.

## Anomaly detection on large-scale graphs
Developed a large-scale graph-based proactive multi-account abuse prevention system for Buyer Abuse Fixed team at Amazon. Worked on graph construction from large-scale tabular user-attribute data, devising node/edge-sampling strategies for efficient training of _graph transformer_ models to improve recall of anomalous user detection under ~70:1 class imbalance.
