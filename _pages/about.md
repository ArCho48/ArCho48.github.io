I am a PhD student in the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), advised by [Santiago Segarra](https://segarra.rice.edu/).
My current research interests lie in graph machine learning, distributed learning, machine learning for wireless, constrained optimization and model-based deep learning.
<span style="color: blue"><b>I am on the job market for full-time research and applied science roles in industry that start in or after August, 2024</b></span>.

From 2017 to 2019, I was a researcher at [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research) in the Deep Learning & Artificial Intelligence group, advised by [Lovekesh Vig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lovekesh-vig-5ba6ba2/?originalSubdomain=in). My research there focused on document information retrieval using deep vision and sequence models. I have a Master's degree in [Signal Processing](https://www.iitg.ac.in/eee/group_details.php?group=20b5783989#) from [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), where I worked on incremental clustering algorithms, advised by [Prithwijit Guha](https://www.iitg.ac.in/eee/faculty_profile.php?name=prg). I have a Bachelor's degree in [Electronics and Communications](https://nitdgp.ac.in/department/electronics-and-communication-engineering) from [NIT Durgapur](https://nitdgp.ac.in/).

My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 4, and the shortest path is given by [Paul Erdős](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s) — [Vance Faber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vance_Faber) — [Gunnar Carlsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Carlsson) — [Santiago Segarra](http://segarra.rice.edu/) — [Arindam Chowdhury](https://archo48.github.io/).
